          It has been just over two years since we received new material from
          PVRIS, but fear not! The trio are ready to present five smashing new
          tracks on the Hallucinations EP, which arrives Friday, October 25,
          2019 thanks to Warner Bros. Life has not been too shabby for Lowell,
          Massachusetts’ Electro-Pop Rockers PVRIS. Formed in 2012, the band
          made their epic debut in 2014 with White Noise. Media attention and a
          welcoming embrace from a growing legion of fans paved the way for
          their sophomore effort, All We Know of Heaven, All We Need of Hell,
          which did wonders for the band. Awards and recognition poured in,
          allowing the eclectic PVRIS to share stages with everyone from Mayday
          Parade and States Champs to Pierce the Veil and Sleeping with Sirens,
          heavyweights Bring Me the Horizon, and Pop-Punk darlings Fall Out Boy.
