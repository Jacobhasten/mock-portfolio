        Blending atmospheric electronic textures with dark alt rock, American trio PVRIS (pronounced "Paris") evolved from post-hardcore underground favorites to pop-savvy international headliners within a decade. Their 2014 debut White Noise was an alternative chart hit in the U.S. and U.K., setting the stage for their pulsing sophomore effort, All We Know of Heaven, All We Need of Hell. By the time album three arrived in 2019, their early hardcore sound had matured into an urgent, dance-friendly hybrid of beat-driven synth rock.

        Formed in Lowell, Massachusetts, the group's earliest incarnation was as a local metalcore outfit before vocalist Lynn Gunn (born Lyndsey Gunnulfsen), former I Am the Fallen guitarist Alex Babinski, bassist Brian Macdonald, and drummer Brad Griffin branched off to form PVRIS At this initial stage of their careers, the band's sound echoed contemporaries such as Tonight Alive, Against the Current, and Paramore. They delivered their self-titled debut EP in early 2013, building up their profile as a live act with some summer dates on the Vans Warped Tour, and in the fall joining the Rise Up Tour with Skylit Drive, Wolves at the Gate, and For All Those Sleeping. Teaming up with producer Blake Harnage
        &lpar;Versa&rpar;, they entered the studio to work on their first album.
